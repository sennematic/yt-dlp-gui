# yt-dlp GUI Wrapper
## Please note this is a work-in-progress
This will be a clean, user-friendly way to use yt-dlp. I created this for an older family member who asks me to download videos for him from YT or FB and I wanted to enable him to do this himself.

Some settings will be geared towards this end (ie: a Microsoft-Preferred option to encode the video files in H.264 by default).
